# IEEE Conference [Typst](https://typst.app) Template
I am preparing for IEEE cofference these days. Frustrated with Latex, I choose Typst to rewrite my paper.

In fact, typst app provides built-in IEEE paper template and [ieee-typst-template](https://github.com/bsp0109/ieee-typst-template) gives a modified edition for author's requiements, but they are not enough.

Based on Word and Latex templates and guidelines, I diy my Typst template.


## What is Typst
Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system that is designed to be as powerful as LaTeX while being much easier to learn and use.
